# MERN STACK

MERN stack is **free and open source JavaScript** software stack for building **dynamic web sites and web applications**.

MERN stack is **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js**. All these 4 support programs that are written in JavaScript.

**Silent Features**
* MERN applications can be written in **one language** fo both _server-side_ and _client-side_ execution environment.
* Single Page Application (SPA)
* MVC design Pattern


# Components of MEAN STACK are as follows
* **MongoDB** : MongoDB is a _cross-platform_ **document-oriented database** program. Classified as a **NoSQL database** program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema. MongoDB is developed by **MongoDB Inc.** and licensed under the **Server Side Public License (SSPL)**.
* **Express.js / Express** : Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as _free and open-source_ software under the _MIT License_. It is designed for building **web applications and APIs**.
* **React.js** : ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building _user interfaces_. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of **single-page or mobile applications**. However React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API,. Redux, React Router and axios are respective examples of such libraries.
* **Node.js** : Node.js is an **open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment** that executes _JavaScript_ code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

# Node Package Manager (NPM)
**npm** is the default package manager for Node.js. You can use npm to install third party libraries (packages) and also manage dependencies between them. The npm registry (www.npmjs.com) is a public repository of all modules published by people for the purpose of sharing.
In fact, even though React is largely client-side code and can be included directly in your HTML as a script file, it is recommended instead that Reactis installed via npm.
